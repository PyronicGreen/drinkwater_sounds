                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Drinkwater Sounds is a remote music studio based out of New York.</p>
                <p>We specialize in session work, either in contributing guitar, bass, keys or ambience/noise to pre-existing tracks
                    or writing entire musical songs for artists, including ideas for melody. We love collaboration and working with artists
                    in their songwriting process. We also specialize in film and videogame scoring.</p>
                <p>With a wide variety of live instrumentation and professional recording software at our disposal, it's no wonder people 
                    have only good things to say about working with Drinkwater:
