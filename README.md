# drinkwater_sounds
The website I made for the remote music studio Drinkwater Sounds.

In the year I've been committed to coding, this is actually the first full site I've put together.
It's built entirely with HTML and CSS, but I will for sure be adding some JS event handling in the near future.
Right now, this site features a smooth-scroll feature and vibrant CSS.
